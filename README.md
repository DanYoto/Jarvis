# Jarvis

Jarvis is a modular AI assistant project inspired by intelligent systems like Iron Man's Jarvis. It aims to combine speech recognition, language model reasoning, and speech synthesis into a seamless conversational assistant.

## Project Structure

```
Jarvis/
â”œâ”€â”€ speech-to-text/    # Converts spoken language into written text
â”œâ”€â”€ LLM-agents/        # Language model agents for reasoning, tools, and tasks
â”œâ”€â”€ text-to-speech/    # Converts text output into spoken audio
```

## Components

### 1. `speech-to-text`
Handles voice input and transcribes it into text using ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) models. Example tools: Whisper, Vosk, DeepSpeech.

### 2. `LLM-agents`
This module uses large language models (e.g., GPT, Claude, or open-source LLMs) to interpret, reason, and respond to input. Includes logic for tool usage, memory, and task execution.

### 3. `text-to-speech`
Synthesizes natural-sounding speech from generated text. Can use tools like Coqui TTS, Google TTS, or ElevenLabs.

## Getting Started

To run each module, refer to its individual `README.md` or script documentation.

## Goals

- Real-time voice assistant with reasoning capabilities
- Modular design for plug-and-play component updates
- Open source, extensible, and privacy-conscious
